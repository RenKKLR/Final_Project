# Trading Performance Query -- Version 2

Why this project:
* practise object-oriented-programming
* structure the code better
* try out web scraping


What does this project do:
* save the bought stocks in a csv file
* save the sold stock in a separate file and check if there is enough stocks bought before saving
* calculate the performance of a single stock
* if the account is not balanced, do the calculation of the single stock performance by inputting the current price of the stock


What functions could be upgraded in the future:
* do portfolio performance
* calculate the performance of selected stocks
* fetch current price from a finance website
* use more mandatory fields and warn if they are not correctly filled in
